📄 Project Description:

In this case study, I analyzed fitness and sleep data from 30+ smart device users to generate actionable insights for Bellabeat, a wellness technology company focused on women’s health. Using R and tidyverse, I explored behavioral trends to recommend personalized strategies that could drive engagement and promote healthier habits.

🔍 Key Findings & Strategic Recommendations:

✅ Sedentary Lifestyles (17+ hours/day)
🔁 Recommendation: Implement in-app movement reminders and “Daily Move Streak” challenges to break long sedentary periods.

✅ Low Activity (Avg. 7,400 steps/day)
🔁 Recommendation: Launch step-based gamification, personalized step goals, and motivational nudges to help users reach 10,000 steps/day.

✅ Sleep Efficiency Patterns (Avg. ~7 hrs/night)
🔁 Recommendation: Offer sleep quality tracking, restfulness scores, and bedtime coaching with mindfulness tools and breathing exercises.

✅ High Activity + Poor Sleep in Some Users
🔁 Recommendation: Target shift workers/athletes with recovery-focused content, hydration reminders, and stress recovery tracking.

✅ Inconsistent Sleep-Activity Behavior
🔁 Recommendation: Classify user profiles with pattern recognition and deliver behavior-based guidance to improve consistency.

🎯 Impact:
My recommendations focus on behavior-based engagement, personalized wellness nudges, and product integration strategies to drive retention and user satisfaction.
